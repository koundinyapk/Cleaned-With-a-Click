# Cleaned-With-a-Click
Welcome to the "Cleaned with a Click" Git repository! This repository contains the source code for a web-based hostel housekeeping management portal which I submitted as my Mini Project during graduation. The portal is designed to automate and simplify the process of managing the cleaning and maintenance of a hostel, providing a seamless experience for both the hostel manager and the housekeeping staff.


# Features:
There are two levels of operation in this project. They are:


1)Admin level

2)Student level

The two levels, individually, have the following pages:


**1)Admin level:**

->Login page

->Dashboard

->Allot Housekeeper

->Complaints

->Suggestions

->Register Housekeeper

->Housekeeper catalogue

->Map Housekeeper



**2)Student level:**

->Login

->Dashboard

->Request

->Feedback

->Profile

->Change Password


# Technology Stack:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap framework for responsive and visually appealing user interfaces.

Backend: PHP scripting language to handle server-side logic and interact with the database.

Database: MySQL used as the relational database management system for storing and retrieving data related to tasks, rooms, staff, and feedback.

# Functionality:
->At first, a student raises a request.

->The requests that were raised from the students gets appeared on the Admin dashboard.

->Then, the admin allots the housekeepers to the requests that were received.

->After the request was served, the onus is on the student to mark the request as completed by submitting the feedback to that request.

->While submitting the feedback, the student can add Suggestions(if any) and Complaints(if any).
